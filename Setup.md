## Setup

To get started you'll need two components:

1. [Download](https://github.com/spacemonkeyJT/FalloutBot/releases/latest/download/FalloutBot.zip).
2. Download the F4CC mod from [f4cc.kmrkle.tv](https://f4cc.kmrkle.tv/). We won't be using Crowd Control itself, so ignore the CCPAK file and the installation help on the page. Download either the installer, or FOMOD version if you're using a mod manager such as Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex.

Install and enable the F4CC mod in Fallout 4.

Extract the FalloutBot.zip file somewhere, then configure the program [Settings](./Settings.md).

Run the FalloutBot.exe program to connect to the configured channel. The program will log out some info to show whether it's connected successfully. In the Twitch chat, use the `#status` command to check if it's working, and `#enable` to enable the integration. See [Moderator Commands](./ModeratorCommands.md) for more info.
