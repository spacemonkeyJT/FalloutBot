## Setup

To get started you'll need two components:

1. [Download](https://github.com/spacemonkeyJT/FalloutBot/releases/latest/download/FalloutBot.zip) the FalloutBot app and extract it somewhere.
2. Download the F4CC mod from https://f4cc.kmrkle.tv/. We won't be using Crowd Control itself, so ignore the CCPAK file and the installation help on the page. Download either the installer, or FOMOD version if you're using a mod manager such as Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex.

Install and enable the F4CC mod
